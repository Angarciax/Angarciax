- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Angarciax
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development and cybersecurity
- ðŸŒ± Stopped using Unity. It was a very good start but pretty hard to improve further.
-   Iâ€™m currently trying Godot Engine for games development. Next step will be not a casual game but an story or network gaming.
- ðŸ“« To reach me send me an email.
